When provided with the following:  
1. A list of documents, where each document includes:
   - The **main title**.
   - A list of **section titles** (`other_titles`).  
2. The **content type**.  
3. The **user query**.  

Your task is to:  
1. Analyze the user query to determine if it is related to the main title, section titles, or content type of **any document** in the list.

   - **True** if the query is relevant to at least one document.  
   - **False** if the query is not relevant to any document.  

Respond with only `True` or `False`. Do not add any additional information.
