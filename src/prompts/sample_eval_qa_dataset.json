      "The paper focuses on investigating and comparing different strategies for constructing prompts for large language models (LLMs) in text-to-SQL tasks across zero-shot, single-domain, and cross-domain settings.",
      "The key components include task instructions, the test database, the test natural language query (NLQ), and optional demonstration examples.",
      "Normalized prompts reduce token counts and improve execution accuracy in most cases for both Codex and ChatGPT.",
      "In-domain demonstrations mitigate LLM sensitivity to different representations of database knowledge and enhance performance, particularly in single-domain settings.",
      "Table relationships and table content are crucial, with specific emphasis on how they are represented in prompts."
